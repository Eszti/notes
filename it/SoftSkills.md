## Pair programming

### Motivation

- learn from each other
- better code quality
- less errors

### Benefits

- two heads are better than one
- review-on-the-go
- shorter code
- effective knowledge sharing
- increased on-boarding efficiency
- develop interpersonal skills

### Disadvantages

- thought interruptions
- prevents from entering into a flow

### Challenges

- peers must be equally engaged
- pairing should happen verbally (load)
- highly social interactive

### Social skills needed

- listen to each other
- share ideas
- must be ready for a compromise
- giving feedback
- engagement and check engagement of the other

### Approaches

- constellations
	- expert - expert
	- expert - novice
	- novice - novice

### Styles

- unstructured
	- let's do this together
- driver - navigator
	- driver
		- types
		- focus on tactical concerns and mechanics (hotkeys, typos, formating...)
	- navigator
		- strategic thinking
		- observer
			- do not dictate, do not scream out, do not distract the driver
		- tasks
			- pay attention to consistence
			- keep an eye on the goal
			- yagni, kiss, dtsttcpw
			- clear communication
			- communicate what not how
	- backseat navigator
		- allowed to dictate tactical things (new file...)
	- tour guide / strong-style pairing / teacher-observer
		- micromanagement (only for onboarding)

### Possible flows

- start with a small task
	- agree on a goal
	- switch
- ping-pong pairing
	- TDD
		- write a failing test
		- other makes it pass
		- switch roles
- rubber ducking
	- explain every line (like you would do to a rubber duck)
	- works even alone

### When to switch?

- time-based
	- pomodoro (25 - 5)
- TDD (ping-pong)	
- session based
	- far-sight navigator who knows the best

### Avoid

- drifting apart, getting distracted by emails
- micromanagement
- impatience (always wait for some sec before pointing out a failure)
- keyboard hogging
- don't pair for 8 hours
